The point of the Olympics in the modern era is broadly to determine which country is the best at sports, but does it actually do that?
Ever think to yourself "hey, why are there four medals in a single weight class of judo that count the same as the three medals in all of a sport like golf?"
And what about the ability of allstar athletes in some sports to get multiple medals in the time it takes a team of eleven to get a single medal in football?

Well, this Excel file has six ways to measure which country is the best at sports coming out of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games:
  - The normal way: number of gold medals
  - The other normal way: total number of medas
  - A weighted medal count (gold 3, silver 2, bronze 1)
  - A weighted medal count with teams getting a medal for every starting athlete
  - Aggregation by sport, like a track meet.  In this method, a country being the best at rugby is equivalent to a country being the best at gymnastics
    - For example, China did the best in the sport of artisitic gymnastics, so they receive one gold medal in this calculation
  - Aggregation by sport and gender.  In this method, acountry being the best at women's rugby is equivalent to a country being the best at men's gymnastics
    - For example, Japan did the best in women's skateboarding, so they receive one gold medal in this calculation, just like Brazil, who did the best in men's skateboarding
    - I believe this is the fairest evaluation of which country is the best at sports
    
Does this matter?
Yes.  After receiving only one gold medal in Atlanta in 1996, the UK changed their sports funding strategy to target higher medal count disciplines like rowing.
Other countries like France and the Netherlands are following suit.
But to many people, the ability to win at team sports is more impressive, and deserves at least equal funding.
If we counted Olympic success by sports rather than events, more funding would be incentivized to go towards team sports.
